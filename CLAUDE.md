# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Static HTML/CSS website for Pembrokeshire Climbing Club. No build tools, no JavaScript framework, no package manager — open files directly in a browser to preview.

## Development

To preview locally, open any `.html` file in a browser from the `site/` directory. There is no build step, server, or dependency installation required.

Pre-commit hooks run Biome formatting checks. Install with:
```
pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
```

## Repository Structure

## Site Architecture

### Page Layout

Every page uses a CSS Grid layout defined on `.wrapper` with three named areas: `header` (nav bar), `border` (left decorative column), and `content` (main body), plus `footer`. On mobile (`max-width: 48em`) the grid collapses to a single column and the border column is hidden with `display: none`.

### CSS Files (`site/css/`)

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `style.css` | Entry point — `@import`s all other files |
| `base.css` | Google Fonts import, global reset |
| `layout.css` | Page grid, grid-area assignments, footer structure |
| `nav.css` | Nav bar, links (desktop inline row) |
| `hamburger.css` | CSS-only hamburger toggle — mobile only |
| `components.css` | Decorative border images, splash image |
| `responsive.css` | All mobile overrides (`max-width: 48em`) |

### Splash Image Overlay

`.splash-image` uses `grid-column: 1 / -1; grid-row: 2` to span both columns in row 2, overlapping `.main-content`. A `.splash-image-block` spacer (350px tall) inside `.main-content` pushes text below the image. Mobile uses `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto` so the content row absorbs spare viewport height rather than inflating the nav row.

### CSS-only Hamburger Menu (`hamburger.css`)

The nav toggle is **mobile-only** (`max-width: 48em`); desktop shows the links as an inline row. It uses no JavaScript: an `<input type="checkbox" id="menu-btn">` paired with a `<label for="menu-btn">` (the visible bars icon). The checkbox, label and `.nav-list` are siblings inside `.primary-nav`, so `.menu-btn:checked` restyles both — morphing the bars into an X and revealing the list, which drops beneath the bar as a full-width overlay via a `max-height` transition.

Accessibility details:
- On mobile the checkbox is *visually hidden but kept in the accessibility tree / tab order* (clipped, not `display:none`), so it stays keyboard-operable; on desktop the whole toggle is `display:none`.
- A visually-hidden `<span class="sr-only">Menu</span>` inside the label gives the checkbox its accessible name; its checked/unchecked state signals open/closed. (Limitation of the CSS-only approach: it is announced as a *checkbox*, not a button with `aria-expanded`, and there is no Escape-to-close.)
- The closed list is `visibility: hidden`, keeping its links out of the tab order until opened.
- Animations are disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- `.sr-only` is a global visually-hidden utility in `base.css`.

## Brand

## Pages

| File | Status |
|---|---|
| `site/index.html` | Home page |
| `site/join_us.html` | Join page (stub — missing shared nav/styles) |
| `members.html` | Linked in nav, not yet created |
| `contact_us.html` | Linked in nav, not yet created |

## CI/CD

Three workflows; the deploy workflows call shared composite actions in `.github/actions/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Jobs |
|---|---|---|
| `on_pr.yaml` | Pull request opened/updated | `lint` (pre-commit) + `publish-preview` (Cloudflare preview) |
| `on_push_main.yaml` | Push to `main` + manual | `publish` (Cloudflare production) |
| `rotate_cloudflare_token.yaml` | Daily cron + manual | `rotate` (applies `iac/deploy_token`) |

Deployment uses `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3` against a direct-upload Pages project — Cloudflare's Git integration is deliberately not used, so the deploy trigger lives in GitHub Actions. Both deploy jobs declare `environment: cloudflare-pages` and read `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` from that environment, not from repository secrets.

The rotation job runs under the separate `cloudflare-token-rotation` environment, which holds the bootstrap credentials (`TF_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `TF_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `TF_STATE_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `TF_STATE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`) plus the repository variable `TF_STATE_BUCKET`. Those credentials mint tokens and are rotated by hand.

## Infrastructure (`iac/`)

Two Terraform root modules, both on the Cloudflare provider `~> 5.19`.

### `deploy_site/`

Manages the Cloudflare Pages project and its custom domain. Local state. Variables: `cloudflare_account_id`, `project_name` (default: `pcc-website`), `production_branch` (default: `main`).

The project has no `source` block, which is deliberate — it is a direct-upload project, so `on_push_main.yaml` owns the deploy trigger and uploads `site/` with wrangler. Adding a `source` block would hand the trigger to Cloudflare's Git integration and leave the rotating token unused.

`production_branch` is load-bearing for the deploy: wrangler only files an upload as a production deployment when its `--branch` matches this value. `on_push_main.yaml` passes `main` literally, and `outputs.tf` exposes `project_name` / `production_branch` so those literals have a documented source.

```
cd iac/deploy_site && terraform init && terraform apply
```

### `deploy_token/`

Issues the Pages deploy token, writes it to the `cloudflare-pages` GitHub environment, and rotates it. Remote state in Cloudflare R2 via the S3 backend (`bucket` passed at init, endpoint from `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`) — local state would mint a new token every scheduled run.

Rotation chain: `time_rotating` (rotation clock in state) → `cloudflare_account_token` → `github_actions_environment_secret`. Two lifecycle settings are load-bearing:

- `replace_triggered_by = [time_rotating.deploy_token]` — a changed token `name` is only a PATCH, so without forced replacement the value never changes.
- `create_before_destroy` — needs the rotation timestamp in the token name, since Cloudflare rejects duplicate token names.

Permission groups are resolved by API name (`Pages Write`, not the dashboard's "Cloudflare Pages: Edit") through `cloudflare_account_api_token_permission_groups_list`, with a precondition that fails loudly on an unmatched name.

The two credentials cannot be collapsed into one. Granting the issued token `Account API Tokens Write` so the rotation could authenticate with it fails at creation — `1001: sub-token is not allowed to have permissions to manage other tokens` — because a token created via the API by another token may never manage tokens. That is why `cloudflare-token-rotation` holds a separate, hand-rotated `TF_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`.
